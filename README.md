# Occupancy Modeling
This occupancy model was performed for my senior honors in the Bartolome Lab at UC Berkeley under Felix Ratcliff. The occupancy model predicts the probability a species inhabits a site based off of it ecosystem variables, like temperature, precipitation, and vegetation coverage.

# Requirements
The occupancy model I used comes from the "unmarked" package in R. The analysis is scripted to be run in RStudio.

To run the code, you must have a CSV spreadsheet formatted with each observation of each species as a row.

# Notes
I am new to GitHub, so I am in the process of cleaning up the code and reformatting for readability. There will be periodic updates and revisions.
